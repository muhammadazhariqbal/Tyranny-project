                            <h3>What is tyranny?</h3>
                            <p>
                                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What is " tyranny"? How is it that
                                humanity is
                                continually duped by
                                Machiavellian
                                leaders? Have we so soon forgotten the warning signs and aspects of a regime bent on
                                tyrannical exercise of power? History's lessons could not be clearer. The tyrant shrouds
                                himself with benevolent aspirations and promises. This has been so for time immemorial:
                            </p>

                            <blockquote><em>
                                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "This and no other is the root from
                                    which a tyrant springs; when he first
                                    appears he
                                    is a protector."</em> ~ Plato
                            </blockquote>

                            <p>
                                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet, it seems humanity is intent on
                                repeating the mistakes of the past; confusing
                                malevolence with benevolence. There seems to be a link between the relationship between
                                a masochist and the sadist, which mimics the relationship between the slave and tyrant.
                                It is by no coincidence that the original sadist and political revolutionary, the
                                Marquis de Sade, understood this best of all:
                            </p>
                            <blockquote><em>
                                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Tyranny, which first frightens
                                    sovereigns, or rather those that govern them, ends
                                    almost always in providing them with pleasures."</em> (Pg. 97, "The Revolutionary
                                Ideas of the Marquis de Sade" ~ "From a 'Race of Masters'", Pg. 446)

                                sign of a despot. Montesquieu would reiterate Plato's thoughts on these matters:
                            </p>
                            <blockquote><em>

                                    that which is perpetuated under the shield of law
                                    and in the name of justice." </em> ~ Montesquieu

                            <p>
                                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Founding Father's commitment to
                                individual liberty may have commenced with the
                                Revolution of 1776, but was forged in the American Civil War. Slavery was the ownership
                                of the products of the life and destiny of the slave. Is that not what a despot demands
                                of its subjects; to surrender all the potential of one's life to the whim of the ruling
                                class? George Fitzhugh was the most ardent of pro-slavery ideologues, and rebuttals to
                                Fitzhugh's writings appeared often in some of Abraham Lincoln's most famous speeches.
                                Note Fitzhugh's claims:

                                    protect the weak'; but protection cannot be efficient
                                    without the power of control."</em> - (Pg. 187, George Fitzhugh, "Cannibals All!" -

                                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fitzhugh believed that the slave
                                benefited from the benevolent protection of the slave
                                owner. He believed in a society orchestrated by a select few, and was quick to compare
                                the plantation to the socialist commune: "Government may do too much for the people, or
                                it may do too little," he thought. "We have committed the latter error":
                            </p>

                                    truth, justice and good sense, there is in the
                                    notions of the Communists, as to the community of property. Socialism was after all,
                                    only "the new fashionable name for slavery."</em> - (George Fitzhugh, "Cannibals

                                many collectivists after him, that the masses have the natural "right" to be cared for:

                                plays a central role in the conflicts of the 20th Century. This was the initial impetus
                                behind "totalitarianism." The "total state" was a "cradle-to-grave" solution, not
                                altogether different than the pro-slavery ideology of George Fitzhugh. August Kubizek,
                                Adolph Hitler's roommate and childhood friend, describes how the young Adolf rolled all
                                social and political problems into one all-encompassing solution termed "The Ideal
                                State":

                                for domination." Those that understood the "tyrannical" governments of the 20th Century
                                understood the dangers of statist governments intent on submerging the individual under
                                the prerogative of the State:

                            <h3>Escape From Freedom</h3>
                            <p>
                                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Despite the clear lessons of WWII,
                                humanity persisted in chasing utopian dreams, where a
                                governing elite lift the burdens of liberty from the individual. Freedom and liberty
                                continued to be interpreted as freedom from want and personal responsibility. The
                                socialist author Erich Fromm in "Escape from Freedom" argues that the servile
                                personality that willingly accepts a master is essentially masochistic:
                            </p>
                            <BLOCKQUOTE><em>
                                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "The masochistic person...is saved
                                    from making decisions, saved from the final
                                    responsibility for the fate of his self, and thereby saved from the doubt of what
                                    decisions to make. He is also saved from the doubt of what the meaning of his life
                                    is or who "he" is. These questions are answered by the relationship to the power to
                                    which he has attached himself. The meaning of his life and the identity of his self
                                    are determined by the greater while into which the self has submerged."</em> (Erich
                                Fromm, "Escape from Freedom," 1941, Pg. 173 ~ "From a 'Race of Masters'", Pg. 486-487)

                                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Erich Fromm's observations were noted
                                by Gorman Beauchamp. Beauchamp continues along the
                                line of thought established by the Marquis de Sade and exposed by Erich Fromm in the
                                midst of the Cold War; that the masochist subject desired to "get rid of the burdens of
                                freedom." Note the clarification that sadism is defined not by a physical desire, but a
                                "wish for power" over others. In turn, the masochist is defined by a wish to surrender
                                autonomy and control. More importantly, this exchange is negotiated upon the guise of
                                benevolence:

                                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Not the infliction of pain per se,
                                    but the "wish for power," Fromm suggests, "is
                                    the most significant expression of sadism," which "appears frequently under the
                                    guise of love. The rule over another person, if one can claim that to rule over him
                                    is for the person's own sake, frequently appears as an expression of love, but the
                                    essential factor is the enjoyment of domination." Indeed, the sadist may give his
                                    victim "everything - everything except one thing: the right to be free and
                                    independent." ---- The sadistic person needs his object just as much as the
                                    masochistic needs his. . . . In both cases the integrity of the individual self is
                                    lost."</em> (Pg. 148, "Utopian as Sadist," Humanitas Journal)

                                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Erich Fromm also points to the fact
                                that historians have mostly misunderstood and
                                mischaracterized this drive to subordinate one's autonomy to charismatic rulers. He
                                clarifies that the likes of Hitler and Stalin did not rise to power through trickery and
                                cunning. This common illusion is a very dangerous reading of history. Ayn Rand addresses
                                this desire to subordinate the individual under the collective in "Atlas Shrugged":

                                You have said it yourself, half in fear, half in hope that the words had no
                                meaning.</br>
                                You have cried that man's sins are destroying the world,</br>

                                You have sacrificed happiness to duty.</br>
                                You have destroyed all that which you held to be evil</br>
